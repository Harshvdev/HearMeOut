# HearMeOuttt

**HearMeOuttt** is a minimalist, anonymous, 18+ confession platform where people can share their unspoken thoughts, secrets, emotions, or experiences freely — without any login, identity, or judgment.

This project was built with the idea of creating a safe, text-only space for real, raw, and honest expression. No usernames. No likes. No comments. Just you, your words, and a place to be heard.

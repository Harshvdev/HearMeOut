# HearMeOuttt üó£Ô∏è

A simple and anonymous web app where anyone can share their thoughts, daily experiences, or anything they want to express ‚Äî without needing an account. Whether you're feeling happy, confused, thoughtful, or just want to speak out, **HearMeOuttt** gives you a place to be heard, judgment-free.

This is a solo project built by [Harsh Vardhan Shukla](https://github.com/Harshvdev) to practice and improve frontend and Firebase development skills.

> üí¨ This isn't just a confession site ‚Äî you're free to share your daily experiences, thoughts, ideas, or feelings anonymously. Confessions are welcome too, as long as they follow the community rules.

üõ°Ô∏è Please keep posts respectful and avoid sharing anything illegal, harmful, or offensive. This is a public space, and we want to keep it safe for everyone.

## üöÄ How to Run It Locally (Optional for Devs)

> **Note:** You don‚Äôt need this if you're just a user. This is for devs who want to test or learn from the code.

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harshvdev/HearMeOut.git
   cd HearMeOut
   ```

2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Firebase config:
   ```
   VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
   VITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
   VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   VITE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   ```

4. Start the local server  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Or just open `index.html` directly in a browser (Firebase features won't work without config).
